# Exercise 09: Create a new module with a couple of functions

You explored the creation of Python extensions with C, Zig, and Rust,
so now is time for you to create a more complex module.

The exercise here is for you to pick one language and add a couple more
functions to the module in order to perform a few simple functions.

Some ideas can be:
* Mathematical operations between two (or more) numbers
* Check if an item is in a list of items
* Sort a list of elements
* List the content of a directory

Please check the documentation pages so you can get more information about
handling parameters and performing some basic operations.

* [Ziggy Pydust and Zig](https://pydust.fulcrum.so/latest/guide/functions/)
* [C language](https://www.c-language.org/resources)
