# Understanding and expanding Python: hands-on experience with the Python internals

On this tutorial you will learn to:

* Explore the core of the standard Python implementation
* Modify the interpreter by adding new functions
* Extend Python with C, Rust, and Zig.

The session will be a combination of a theoretical introduction of the topics,
followed by a hands-on experience on each step.

Here is an outline of what will be done:

* Navigating CPython (short presentation)
* Setting up a development environment
* Compiling CPython from source
* Adding a free function to the interpreter
* Adding a new method to a Python container (list or set)
* Extending CPython (short presentation)
* Minimal C-extension for "Hello World"
* Minimal Rust, and Zig extensions for "Hello World",
* Create a new extension replacing Python functionality with C, Rust and Zig.
